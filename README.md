# MADE
MADE (Measuring Adaptive Distance and vaccine Efficacy using allelic barcodes) is a computational package calibrating the strength of passage adaptation happened in a given isolate (strain). The strength of the passage adaptation is defined as the Adaptive Distance (AD) between the center of the major cluster of all isolates in the database and the strain of interest in the principle component analysis (PCA)(See Chen et al for details). Since adaptive distance is found to be negatively correlated with the vaccine efficacy, MADE will also predict potential vaccine efficacy of the input isolate using its nucleotide sequence.
